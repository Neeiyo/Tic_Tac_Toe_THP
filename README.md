# Tic_Tac_Toe_THP

THIS IS A README ABOUT THE PAINFULL EXPERIANCE WE JUST HAD REGARDING TIC TAC TOE

you probably won't read any of it so i'm just gonna put a lot of text here, in english obviously.
It's remarkably surprising to embrace the fact that a 2 minutes kids' game could become such a painfull hair-pulling experience when it comes to turning it into code.
I truly wanted to try and end up coding videogames and shit but no. Not again
That shit's on an other level.
I'm now aiming at selling wordpress websites to people who know nothing about it, charging extra for every template modification.

Some actually do live, and get paid, to do so. I don't see why i couldn't straight up scam boomers myself.

Anyway, if this shit works, I hope you'll enjoy the 5 seconds you spend playing with it, before turning back to playing with yourself.
Do keep in your narrow little mind that it took me (& of course my very much more talented friends) litteral HOURS to get there.

Best regards,

Us
